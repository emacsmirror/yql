h2. About

YQL.el is a simple interface to "YQL (Yahoo! Query Language)":http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/,
a developer tool with a super-neat API which provides access to many Yahoo! web services
(such as flickr). The goal is to provide a simple, somewhat Lispy way to interact with YQL
without having to load up a browser (a lot of Emacs users live there -- trust us!).

h2. Usage

YQL supports three main statements: show, desc, and select (kind of like other *QLs).
So too does YQL.el.

Select:

    (yql 'select "item.condition.temp" "weather.forecast" "location=30313")

Desc:

    (yql 'desc "flickr")

Show:

    (yql 'show)

Note that @yql@ is just a macro that expands to one of @yql-select@, @yql-desc@, or @yql-show@.
So, feel free to just use those like you'd expect.

However, you don't always want "just a tree" of data. That's where @yql-filter@ comes in.

    (yql-filter
     'title
     (yql-filter
      'item
      (yql-select
       "title,pubDate" "rss"
       "url='http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/wfarr.rss' LIMIT 1"))) ;; would return the text of my most recent tweet

As you can see, it's pretty useful. For some examples of how to use these, check out
@yql-twitter-stream@ or @yql-yahoo-stocks@.
