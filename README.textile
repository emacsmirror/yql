YQL.el is a simple interface to "YQL (Yahoo! Query Language)":http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/,
a developer tool with a super-neat API which provides access to many Yahoo! web services
(such as flickr). The goal is to provide a simple, somewhat Lispy way to interact with YQL
without having to load up a browser (a lot of Emacs users live there -- trust us!).

This project was implemented as part of "Yahoo! University Hack Day":http://developer.yahoo.com/hacku/gt.html
at Georgia Tech, March 2009 and won the award for "Hack for Good".

Right now, the codebase is in a state of near-constant change, so documentation will be
left alone for now. The in-code documentation should be accurate, so use that.
