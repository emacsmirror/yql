                 Emacs is the self-extensible, self-documenting editor.
          
               The bulk of it is an Emacs Lisp interpreter written in C...
          
                   ...and the rest is completely editable Emacs Lisp.
          
          
                      It's truly an editor you can make your own.

                                  Yes, with Lisp.
