                       Don't get us wrong: vim is cool too.
          
                       We have the sales pitch for a reason:
          
                "We aren't gonna lie. Emacs sucks. Some of us tolerate it,
                but we can't tell you if YOU'LL be able to. Try it and make
                                 up your own mind."


                             Doesn't stop us from trying.
