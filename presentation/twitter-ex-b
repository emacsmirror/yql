     Now, to be like all the other cool Twitter hackers, it's tweet-fetching time:

                                      Example:
                          (yql-fetch-latest-tweet "codepo8")

                                      Returns:
            "@t3rmin4t0r that is the data twitter gives me. all that is in
                       the table is all I have at my disposal :)"

                      Thanks to the Yahoo! guys for being awesome.
                             We're going to go sleep now.
