          The two most important parts of the API are 'select' and 'filter'.

                                     Example:
        (yql 'select "item.condition.temp" "weather.forecast" "location=30332")

                                     Returns:
         ((query (results (channel (item (condition (temp . "72"))))) ... ))
                       (where ... is the diagnostic etc info)


                         It's just a tree of S-expressions.
                             Lisp loves S-expressions.
                                   Code is data.
