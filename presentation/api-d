          The two most important parts of the API are 'select' and 'filter'.

                                     Example:
   (yql 'filter 'temp
        (yql 'select "item.condition.temp" "weather.forecast" "location=30332"))

                                     Returns:
                                       "72"



           (yql 'filter symbol list) simply performs a depth first search.
         Naturally, you can chain filters together when dealing with queries
                          that return lots of nested data.
